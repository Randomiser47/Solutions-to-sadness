# SHELL IN PYTHON
## COOL VENTURE
I never knew how cool shells actually were untill i tried making one. I thought all commands were just cooked 
into the shell but just learnt that they were also programs like ### ls I was like bruh??? WHAT THAT IS A PROGRAM
VERY VERY COOL FINDING. i'll keep trying to update this bad boy and probably make him into my own personal shell.
